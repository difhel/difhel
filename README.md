### 💻 Development Skills
Do you really need a big list of every technology I've ever worked with? :)

I guess not, so superficially:

- I have high expertise in frontend - mostly write in Typescript and React, love SCSS and know how to work with webpack/vite builders
- Made social media bots using `aiogram` for Telegram and `vkbottle` for VKontakte. The most popular project is used by 40K+ people
- I write backend - love `fastapi` in Python ❤️, had experience with PHP, Express.js and C++ `httplib`
- Doing devops stuff - bash native speaker, actively using Docker and Ansible
