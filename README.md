  <h3>üíª Development Skills</h3>
</p>
Do you really need a big list of every technology I've ever worked with? :)

I guess not, so superficially:

- I have high expertise in frontend - mostly write in Typescript and React, love SCSS and know how to work with webpack/vite builders
- Made social media bots using `aiogram` for Telegram and `vkbottle` for VKontakte. The most popular project is used by 40K+ people
- I write backend - love `fastapi` in Python ‚ù§Ô∏è, had experience with PHP, Express.js and C++ `httplib`
- Doing devops stuff - bash native speaker, actively using Docker and Ansible

  <h3>üìÇ My projects</h3>
</p>

I've worked on a lot of very different projects, most of them under NDA, but here are the most interesting ones:

- **[Elan Contest Management System](https://github.com/elansteam/backend)**. My team is working on creating the next-generation platform for holding programming contests. Say goodbye to Codeforces and Leetcode!
- **[VKGPT](https://gg.gg/vkgpt2)**. My Samsung IT School graduation project - an unofficial VK Messenger client with automatic one-click replies powered by [ai-messenger-suggestions](https://github.com/difhel/ai-messenger-suggestions)
- **[MyTonWallet](https://github.com/mytonwalletorg/mytonwallet)**. Open-source feature-rich TON wallet ‚Äì with support of staking, multi-accounts, tokens, Ledger, NFT, TON DNS, TON Sites, TON Proxy, and TON Magic.


Explore these projects to see what I've been working on. They showcase my passion for coding and my dedication to delivering high-quality solutions. üòÑ
